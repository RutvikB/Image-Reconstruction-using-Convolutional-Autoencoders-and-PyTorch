# Image-Reconstruction-using-Convolutional-Autoencoders-and-PyTorch
Image Reconstruction and Restoration of Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset using PyTorch's Torch and Torchvision Libraries <br>

The Dataset was obtained from Microsoft's official webpage at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765 <br>

This dataset contains 12500 unique images of Cats and Dogs each, and collectively were used for training the convolutional autoencoder model and the trained model is used for the reconstruction of images.
